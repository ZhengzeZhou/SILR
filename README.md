# SILR

## Description
SILR is abbreviated for single-individual likelihood ratio test, which is described in the paper: ...

This repository contains the main functions in [SILR.R](https://github.com/ZhengzeZhou/SILR/blob/master/SILR.R), and a correspongding [Shiny app](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) design in [app.R](https://github.com/ZhengzeZhou/SILR/blob/master/app.R) for easy and interactive use. 

## Installation
To use the program, there are several options:

1. For those familiar with R and Shiny, they may directly download the R scripts and run the program locally. And they could also make modifications based on specific needs.
1. To directly run the program, run "runGitHub("SILR", "ZhengzeZhou")" in the console of R studio. Here "SILR" is the repository name, and "ZhengzeZhou" is the username for Github.
1. Reviewers of the paper may directly access the Shiny program at https://zhengzez.shinyapps.io/silr/. It is emplyed by [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/). Please note that there is a budget limit on the total running time, and thus we will later remove this option.
